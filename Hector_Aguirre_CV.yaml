    summary:
      - Software Engineer with 7+ years' experience in software development and over 2 years of experience leading teams of developers across LATAM. I love new challenges and I am an inquisitive individual, always eager to learn new things with exceptional problem-solving skills. I have extensive experience with Golang, Python, Javascript, Typescript, IaC (Terraform, CDK, SST), cloud providers (AWS, GCP), different types of databases (SQL, DynamoDB, ElasticSearch), CI/CD Pipelines, and test automation.
